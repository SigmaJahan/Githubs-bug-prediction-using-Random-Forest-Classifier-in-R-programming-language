Using GitHub to anticipate bugs, features, and questions might be advantageous for better resource use.  The GitHub Bugs Prediction dataset from Kaggle is utilized for forecasting, and Random Forest Classification using TDM is employed to predict bugs, features, and questions based on GitHub titles and text content. This report will compare the Random Forest performance evaluations for different tree counts. With such a massive dataset comprising text data, there is a lot to consider while analyzing it, primarily because of the preprocessing required to represent raw text and make it worthwhile
